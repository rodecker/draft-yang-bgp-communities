        This document provides a YANG module for describing BGP communities.

         The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
         NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
         "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
         described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/>
         when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">

      <t>
        ISP operators use BGP communities<xref target="RFC1997"/><xref target="RFC4360"/><xref target="RFC8092"/> to add information to prefix announcements or to let customers influence routing behaviour inside the network of the ISP.
        Each ISP defines for itself which BGP communities to support and how the structure of these communities should be interpreted.
        This document provides a YANG<xref target="RFC7950"/> module for describing the structure and meaning of BGP communities, Extended BGP communities and Large BGP communities.
        ISP operators can use this to publish their community definitions in a well-defined format.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Rationale" anchor="rationale">

      <t>
        ISP operators may define various BGP communities that have local significance inside of their network.
        These communities could be used to add miscellaneous information to a prefix announcement.
        For example, a community "64501:1:528" may signify that AS64501 is originating a prefix from a point of presence in The Netherlands (ISO 3166-1 code 528).
        Alternatively, communities could be used to allow customers of an ISP to control routing behavior of their prefixes inside the ISP.
        For example, a community "64501:4:64498" attached to a prefix advertised to AS64501 by a customer may be interpreted by AS64501 to mean that this prefix must not be propagated to AS64498.
      </t>
      <t>
        For both use cases it is necessary for the ISP to communicate the meaning of their locally defined communities to others.
        Currently this is typically done by publishing a list of communities on a web page, or as a remark inside an autnum object in the Internet Routing Registry.
        This makes it cumbersome to determine if and where an ISP publishes community information.
        The lack of a well-defined structure makes it hard to develop tools for parsing community information.
      </t>
      <t>
        The purpose of the YANG model defined in this document is to provide a standardized format for publishing community definitions.
        These definitions help applications to interpret the structure and purpose of BGP communities.
        For example, looking glasses may use the published definitions to parse communities seen in BGP announcements and display their meaning.
        Another potential use case is in generating routing policy configurations based on community definitions published by an upstream ASN.
        This could be done automatically using external tooling to generate router configurations, or inside a router's command-line interface by importing the definitions and providing the CLI-user with available choices for manual configuration.
      </t>
      <t>
        Note that this document only describes a model for the publishing format of community definitions.
        The publishing location and publishing mechanism used are outside the scope of this specification.

      <section title="Publishing guidelines" anchor="recommendations.publishing">
        <t>
          Operators SHOULD only publish BGP community definitions for networks they control.
          This may include communities where the Global Administrator field contains a private ASN, if this community has a local meaning inside the network of the publisher.
        </t>
        <t>
          When publishing community definitions with overlapping field patterns these MUST be ordered from most to least specific, to ensure parsers can perform deterministic matching.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Parsing guidelines" anchor="recommendations.parsing">
        <t>
          A published BGP community definition can be used by parsers to display information about a received community.
          If a received community matches multiple published community definitions, the first community in the published order takes precedence.
        </t>
        <t>
          By default, communities are compared using the decimal representation of the fields. If "format" for a Local Administrator or Local Data Part is set to "binary", the fields in the received community are converted to strings of zeros and ones before comparison.
        </t>
        <t>
          Applications that parse these community definitions SHOULD reject objects that do not comply with the rules described in this document.
          Furthermore, parsers SHOULD check that the sum of the specified Local Administrator or Local Data Part field lengths in each community definition does not exceed the local part size of the specified community type.
          For example: A Regular BGP community definition with format "decimal" containing a field of length 4 and a field of length 2 would be illegal, as the Local Administrator field has a maximum length of 65535 (5 digits).
